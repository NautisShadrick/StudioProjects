This is a chill hangout world where players fly kites

There is Wind with direction and speed, that changes over time.

A kite is and object that has a line attaching it to its player, the wind blows the kite up, and when the player moves it also helps pull the kite up

if there is no wind running pull the kite up then it slowly falls down, but if there is wind it pulls it up

the kite line is a fixed length for the physics

each kite alao has a line render tail with some gravity physics opne end attached to the kite and one end loose.
